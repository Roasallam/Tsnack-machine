ProgressSoft Task: PART 2:

1- What are Mutation Observers in JavaScript?
   The MutationObserver interface provides users to avoid polling for changes in the DOM,
for example: 
   there is a list item which changes as required frequently,
in javaScript code, I assign that list item as a target node that will be observed for configured mutations, such as attributes, 
   Then I create a function to define the behavior which should execute when mutations are 
   observed, and pass it to an observer instance, finaly I start observing the target node.

2- Explain 3 different CSS selectors:
A) element selector:
     - it is used to set the style for HTML element by writing the element name.
     - for example: 
                   lable {
                   font-family: arial;
                   }

B) id selector:
     - it is used to set the style for HTML element with specified id attribute.
     - for example:
                   #line1 {
                   font-family: arial;
                   }

C) class selector:
     - it is used to set the style for HTML elements which have specified their class attribute.
     - for example:
                   .new_class {
                   font-family: arial;
                   }

3- What is the difference between SessionStorage and LocalStorage in HTML5?
   Before HTML5, application data had to be stored in cookies, and each cookie has an expiration date, but 
   As for LocalStorage, the data is stored until it is explicitly deleted. Changes made are
 saved and available for all current and future visits to the site.
   While in SessionStorage the data is not persistent i.e. it will be lost once the window 
 tab is closed.

   It also may differ from each other withen different browsers, each storage may has a different storage limit.
